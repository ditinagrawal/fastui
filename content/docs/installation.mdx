description: Learn how can you use FastUI in your projects.

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing FastUI blocks is as simple as running the shadcn add command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as `https://fastui.ditin.in/r/<component-name>.json`

The entire install process is handled by the shadcn CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

```npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://fastui.ditin.in/r/<component-name>.json
```

For example, to install the Hello World component, you would run:

```npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://fastui.ditin.in/r/hello-world.json
```
